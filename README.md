# microservices-java
First work of the subject "Distributed Systems", that was built using architecture of microservices.

The aplication consists in two microservices, the first one is shoes-info that is a data base of shoes, and the second one is user-cart, those microservices works with direct communication, so both needs to be start and them communicate each other directly, without using any broke or something like that.

The user-cart consists in a list of the entity shoes of shoes-info.

To make the requests I used the Insomnia.
